Hi there! üëã Hope everything is going okay using projects from the Carbon Design
System. It looks like you might have a question about our work, so we wanted to
share a couple resources that you could use if you haven't tried them yet üôÇ.

If you're an IBMer, we have a couple of Slack channels available across all IBM
Workspaces:

- #carbon-design-system for questions about the Design System
- #carbon-components for questions about component styles
- #carbon-react for questions about our React components

If these resources don't work out, help us out by filling out a couple of
details below!

## What package(s) are you using?

<!--
  Add an x in one of the options below, for example:
- [x] package name
-->

- [ ] `carbon-components`
- [ ] `carbon-components-react`

## Summary

## Relevant information

<!-- Provide as much useful information as you can -->
